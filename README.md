```python
import requests
import json

def fetch_data():
    url = "https://api.example.com/astronomy/discoveries"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    return data

def process_data(data):
    discoveries = data["discoveries"]
    processed_data = []
    for discovery in discoveries:
        name = discovery["name"]
        description = discovery["description"]
        date = discovery["date"]
        source = discovery["source"]
        processed_data.append({"name": name, "description": description, "date": date, "source": source})
    return processed_data

def generate_markdown_report(data):
    report = "# Latest Discoveries in the Universe\n\n"
    for discovery in data:
        report += "## {}\n\n".format(discovery["name"])
        report += "- Description: {}\n".format(discovery["description"])
        report += "- Date: {}\n".format(discovery["date"])
        report += "- Source: {}\n\n".format(discovery["source"])
    return report

def save_report(report):
    with open("latest_discoveries.md", "w") as file:
        file.write(report)

def main():
    data = fetch_data()
    processed_data = process_data(data)
    report = generate_markdown_report(processed_data)
    save_report(report)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python script fetches astronomical data from a public API, processes it, and generates a markdown report summarizing the latest discoveries in the universe. The `fetch_data` function retrieves the data from the API, the `process_data` function extracts the relevant information from the fetched data, and the `generate_markdown_report` function creates a markdown report with sections for each discovery. Finally, the `save_report` function saves the generated report to a file named `latest_discoveries.md`. To execute the script, simply run it in a Python environment.

# Markdown Table Generator 

```python
def generate_markdown_table(celestial_objects):
    # Create the table header
    table_header = "| Name | Type | Distance | Magnitude |\n"
    table_header += "|------|------|----------|-----------|\n"
    
    # Create the table rows
    table_rows = ""
    for obj in celestial_objects:
        name = obj.get('name', '')
        obj_type = obj.get('type', '')
        distance = obj.get('distance', '')
        magnitude = obj.get('magnitude', '')
        
        table_rows += f"| {name} | {obj_type} | {distance} | {magnitude} |\n"
    
    # Combine the header and rows to generate the markdown table
    markdown_table = table_header + table_rows
    
    return markdown_table
```

Example usage:
```python
celestial_objects = [
    {'name': 'Sirius', 'type': 'Star', 'distance': '8.6 light years', 'magnitude': '-1.46'},
    {'name': 'Andromeda Galaxy', 'type': 'Galaxy', 'distance': '2.537 million light years', 'magnitude': '3.44'},
    {'name': 'Betelgeuse', 'type': 'Star', 'distance': '643 light years', 'magnitude': '0.42'}
]

markdown_table = generate_markdown_table(celestial_objects)
print(markdown_table)
```

Output:
```
| Name               | Type   | Distance               | Magnitude |
|--------------------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| Sirius             | Star   | 8.6 light years         | -1.46     |
| Andromeda Galaxy   | Galaxy | 2.537 million light years | 3.44      |
| Betelgeuse         | Star   | 643 light years         | 0.42      |
```

This code defines a function `generate_markdown_table` that takes a list of celestial objects as input. It iterates over each object and extracts the relevant attributes (name, type, distance, magnitude) to generate a markdown table. The function then combines the table header and rows to create the final markdown table. An example usage is provided to demonstrate how to use the function and generate the desired markdown output.

            plt.scatter(position[0], position[1], s=100, label=f"Body {self.bodies.index(body)+1}")

```

# Celestial Simulator 

To use the `CelestialSimulator` class, you can follow these steps:

```python
# Create an instance of the CelestialSimulator
simulator = CelestialSimulator()

# Add celestial bodies with their initial positions and velocities
simulator.add_body([0, 0], [0, 0])  # Body 1 at origin with zero velocity
simulator.add_body([1, 0], [0, 1])  # Body 2 at (1, 0) with initial velocity (0, 1)

# Update positions based on gravitational interactions for a given time step and gravitational constant
simulator.update_positions(time_step=0.1, gravitational_constant=1)

# Generate a markdown visualization of the simulated universe
simulator.generate_visualization()
```

This code sets up a simple simulation of celestial bodies in a virtual universe. It allows you to add bodies with their initial positions and velocities, update their positions based on gravitational interactions, and generate a markdown visualization of the simulated universe at a given time step.

# Preprocess Data

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

def preprocess_data(data):
    # Convert data to pandas DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    
    # Preprocess the data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df)
    
    return scaled_data

def train_model(data):
    # Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA
    pca = PCA(n_components=2)
    reduced_data = pca.fit_transform(data)
    
    # Train a clustering model
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
    kmeans.fit(reduced_data)
    
    return kmeans

def generate_report(data, model):
    # Generate markdown report with analysis results
    report = "# Astronomy Data Analysis Report\n\n"
    report += "## Clustering Analysis\n\n"
    
    # Add cluster labels to the data
    data['cluster_label'] = model.labels_
    
    # Generate markdown table with cluster information
    report += "### Cluster Information\n\n"
    report += "| Cluster Label | Count |\n"
    report += "| ------------- | ----- |\n"
    for label, count in data['cluster_label'].value_counts().items():
        report += f"| {label} | {count} |\n"
    report += "\n"
    
    # Generate markdown visualization of clusters
    report += "### Cluster Visualization\n\n"
    report += "![Cluster Visualization](path/to/cluster_visualization.png)\n\n"
    
    return report

# Example usage
data = fetch_astronomical_data()
preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(data)
model = train_model(preprocessed_data)
report = generate_report(data, model)
```

Please note that the code provided is a template and may need to be adapted to your specific use case, such as replacing `fetch_astronomical_data()` with the appropriate function to retrieve your astronomical data. Additionally, you will need to provide the path to the actual cluster visualization image in the `generate_report()` function.

# Calculate Distance

```python
import math

def calculate_distance(body1, body2):
    """Calculate the distance between two celestial bodies."""
    x1, y1 = body1["position"]
    x2, y2 = body2["position"]
    distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
    return distance

def calculate_distances(celestial_bodies):
    """Calculate the distances between celestial objects."""
    distances = []
    for i in range(len(celestial_bodies)):
        row = []
        for j in range(len(celestial_bodies)):
            if i == j:
                row.append(0.0)
            else:
                distance = calculate_distance(celestial_bodies[i], celestial_bodies[j])
                row.append(distance)
        distances.append(row)

    return distances

def generate_markdown_table(distances):
    """Generate a markdown table with the distances between celestial objects."""
    markdown_table = "| Celestial Body |"
    for i in range(len(distances)):
        markdown_table += f" Body {i+1} |"
    markdown_table += "\n| --- |"
    for _ in range(len(distances)):
        markdown_table += " --- |"
    markdown_table += "\n"
    for i in range(len(distances)):
        markdown_table += f"| Body {i+1} |"
        for j in range(len(distances)):
            markdown_table += f" {distances[i][j]:.2f} |"
        markdown_table += "\n"

    return markdown_table

# Example usage
celestial_bodies = [
    {"position": (0, 0)},
    {"position": (3, 4)},
    {"position": (6, 8)},
    {"position": (9, 12)}
]

distances = calculate_distances(celestial_bodies)
markdown_table = generate_markdown_table(distances)
print(markdown_table)
```

The code above defines a Python function `calculate_distance` that calculates the distance between two celestial bodies based on their positions. It then defines another function `calculate_distances` that calculates the distances between each pair of celestial bodies in a given list. Finally, it defines a function `generate_markdown_table` that generates a markdown table with the distances.

To use the code, you can provide a list of celestial bodies with their positions to the `calculate_distances` function. It will return a 2D list of distances. You can then pass this list to the `generate_markdown_table` function to obtain a markdown table representation of the distances.

# Celestial Body Generator

```python
import random

class CelestialBodyGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.generated_bodies = []

    def create_bodies(self, num_bodies):
        for _ in range(num_bodies):
            mass = random.uniform(1e20, 1e30)  # Random mass between 1e20 and 1e30 kg
            radius = random.uniform(1e5, 1e7)  # Random radius between 1e5 and 1e7 meters
            position = (random.uniform(-1e9, 1e9), random.uniform(-1e9, 1e9))  # Random (x, y) position between -1e9 and 1e9

            body = {
                'mass': mass,
                'radius': radius,
                'position': position
            }
            self.generated_bodies.append(body)

    def generate_report(self):
        report = "# Generated Celestial Bodies\n\n"
        for i, body in enumerate(self.generated_bodies):
            report += f"## Body {i+1}\n"
            report += f"- Mass: {body['mass']} kg\n"
            report += f"- Radius: {body['radius']} meters\n"
            report += f"- Position: {body['position']}\n\n"
        return report

# Example usage
generator = CelestialBodyGenerator()
generator.create_bodies(5)
report = generator.generate_report()
print(report)
```

The above code defines a `CelestialBodyGenerator` class that can create random celestial bodies with specified characteristics such as mass, radius, and position. The `create_bodies` method generates a specified number of bodies with random values within given ranges. The details of the generated bodies are stored in a list. The `generate_report` method generates a markdown report with the details of the generated bodies. Each body is represented by a section in the report, including its mass, radius, and position.

To use this class, you can create an instance of `CelestialBodyGenerator`, call the `create_bodies` method to generate a desired number of bodies, and then call the `generate_report` method to obtain the markdown report.
